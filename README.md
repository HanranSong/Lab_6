## Description
You will implement a simple program that uses a two-dimensional nested list to represent a rectangular grid of cells on a map. Each cell contains a value that represents the housing price for a typical house in that cell. The data is contained in a file that you read at the start. However, the data is incomplete - there are some missing values, represented by zeros in this grid. A realtor estimates such a missing price by taking the average of the prices in the neighboring cells. The realtor is also interested in the average and the maximum price of housing in the whole neighborhood (the whole grid).
